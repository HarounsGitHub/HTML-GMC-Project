The objective of the second checkpoint (HTML):

At this checkpoint, you’re instructed to:

use semantic tags.
add a video/audio to the web page.
use local links, lists, or tables.
use HTML forms.
Here's an example to use as a guideline (keep in mind not to replicate it entirely. Try to be creative.)

Instructions
1- Create the navbar: home, about, work, resume, contact

2- Create the “about” section, ”work” section, ”resume” section, and ”contact” section (using HTML Forms) 

3- Create the page footer.


_______________________________________
Following the guideline and instructions with creativity as requested:

I will use all the necessary and convenient semantic tags for this project, <header>, <article>, <figure>, <footer>
to make clear sections for a semantic HTML that respects the logical hierarchy, from the HTML root
to the entire tree - DONE
I will add a video to the web page - DONE
I will use local links, lists/tables - DONE
I will also use an external link to add my GMC profile picture as a favicon
use HTML forms with clear descriptions (placeholder attribute)- DONE
I created the navbar, the different sections, and the footer
check if it fits 'the portfolio condition" - DONE
For creativity purposes: I used <fieldset> I learned from treecodecamp.org, 
<legend>, <label>, comments <!-- comment -->, filled the alt/img alt attribute, 
ordered & unordered lists, <figcaption>, headings with different importance, 
<strong> to make some important words bold - DONE
